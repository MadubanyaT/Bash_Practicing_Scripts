# Bash Scripting 

This repository is where I practice Bash scripting and build my command-line skills using the Vim editor. Check it out if you want to ***grep*** something from it!

## Objective
- Strengthen my command-line skills.
- Automate routine system tasks using Bash.
- Understand and implement scripting logic (conditionals, loops, functions).
- Practice debugging and optimising scripts

## Coming soon
Once I have completed everything, I will add:
- Helpful Bash resources
- My top scripting tips
- Projects anyone can try to practice
