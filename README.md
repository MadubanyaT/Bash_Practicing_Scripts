# Bash Scripting 

 In this repository I will be practicing bash scripting, and there will be sharing some useful tips. Feel free to add your input.  

I'll be using vim editor to create my scripts, killing two birds with one stone :)

 When I have completed my "practice journey" I'll share valuable resources on this README file for anyone who wanna learn bash, so stay tuned!
